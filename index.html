      <h1>ANIME</h1>
      <p>
        Watching Anime has always been a part of my childhood,hence it has
        become a hobby. Lessons await you in every episode or movie you’re
        watching. These values serve as an inspiration to appreciate life at all
        times. Even if you’re not a die-hard anime fan, you would be intrigued
        to watch an anime because of its characters.

        <span
          >Sometimes it’s just more fun to learn from cartoons than boring
          textbooks. Anime provides an emotional connection to characters‘
          struggles that helps us relate and understand the message of the
          story.</span

          >Anime is great brain food because it stimulates our imagination in
          ways that no other media can match. It sparks creativity through
          limitless possibilities and encourages originality. And who doesn’t
          need more creative thinking going on?</span

          listened to, which in turn strengthens your relationships or builds
          them up if they’re already strong.</span

        <li>Anime fans are creative</li>
        <span
          >Anime fans are also more creative than those who don’t watch shows
          because they have a higher attention span which leads them to think
          outside of the box and come up with some really unique solutions when
          faced with problems.

        <li>Fans of anime have a unique sense of humor</li>
        <span
          >A funny thing about grown up anime fans: studies show that even
          though they may start off feeling embarrassed over watching cartoons
          on television, adults who watch them regularly will develop a sense of
          humor that differs from others.</span

          or video game. It’s an experience that can be both challenging and
          rewarding.</span

        <li>Learn Japanese</li>
        <span
          >The beauty of being able to watch movies or shows in Japanese without
          subtitles could never be overstated: Anime helps people who struggle
          with foreign languages immensely by providing them with a visual
          translation while still allowing them to practice listening
          comprehension through dialogue-heavy scenes. It’s possible! And fun
          too!</span

          When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found
          safety behind massive walls that stopped the giants in their tracks.
          But the safety they have had for so long is threatened when a colossal
          Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into
          what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage that follows,
          soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour his mother, which
          leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists some
          friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last
          hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters.
